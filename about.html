      <h1> Alternate Mom </h1>
      <p> No, I don't hate men. No, I have nothing against people getting married early or having kids in their 20's. Please don't start throwing rocks at me (Cheez-its are acceptable, though). </p>
      <p> So why Alternate Mom? </p>
      <p> This advice generator was inspired by the most important person in my life: my Mom. I noticed that a few of my friends had parents that put pressure on them to find a boyfriend ASAP and to get married. I realized how lucky I was that I had a mother who pushed for me to embrace being on my own and to show gratitude for my independence as a woman. She had so many lovely little sayings that I wished my single friends could hear. And so, Alternate Mom was born.</p>
      <p> Frandz, no matter what, always know that you are good enough exactly as you are. Don't let society tell you what to do.</p>
      <p> Note: Some quotes are my mom's, some are my own, some belong to famous people, and some belong to an independently-minded toucan.</p>
