        <p> No silly, I don't hate men. Nor do I have anything against people getting married early or having kids in their 20's. Please don't start throwing rocks at me (Cheez-its are acceptable, though). </p>
        <p><a href="index.html">Alternate Mom</a> was inspired by the most important, badass person in my life. I am so lucky to have a mother who pushes me to love being on my own and to be grateful for my independence. I have friends that are constantly nagged by their parents about marriage or who feel like they are missing out thanks to Facebook engagement photos. My mom would have so many things to say to them. And so, Alternate Mom was born.</p>
        <p> Frandz, no matter what, always know that you are good enough exactly as you are. Don't let society or your parents tell you what you're worth.</p>
        <p> Love, <a href="http://www.kellysrobinson.com" target="_blank">Kelly.</a></p>
